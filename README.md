Simple 10 Question Trivia Game Based on Mel Brooks Star Wars Parody SPACEBALLS.

How to Play

You are given 10 randomized questions with 4 possible answers.
But there is a catch, you only have 25 seconds to answer. 
If you don't answer within the amount of time, the game moves on to the next question and your time starts anew.
At the end of the 10th and final question the game will give you a break down of your scores from correct answers, wrong answers, and unanswered with the option to play again.
